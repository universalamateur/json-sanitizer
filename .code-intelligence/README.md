# Fuzzing the OWASP JSON-Sanitizer

## What is JSON-Sanitizer?

JSON-Sanitizer is a tool that is able to convert JSON-like content to
well-formed JSON that satisfies any well-known parser. It corrects minor mistakes
in encoding and makes it easier to embed any JSON in HTML and XML. In addition,
it offers security features to sanitize some script tags that could result in a
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack.

## The problem

The problem with writing sanitizers is that in order to be correct, it has to handle
a lot of edge cases in stripping out harmful bits of the input. Failure to do so results
in an adversary being able to inject unwanted content into the trusted output, i.e. in
the case of an XSS injection, where the attacker can inject JavaScript into something
that will be rendered as HTML by the browser.

## The solution

Luckily, with fuzz testing, there is an effective way to find these kind of bugs 
and other unforseen edge cases. Instead of testing the program with individual
specific inputs, the fuzzer generates thousands of them per second while trying
to explore different execution paths and maximizing the code coverage in the
program under test.

As JSON-Sanitizer is written mostly in Java, we are particularly concerned with
out of memories, infinite loops and logic bugs. Out of memories and infinite
loops can be exploited to achieve a denial of service of the application. Logic
bugs could enable to bypass the XSS tag sanitization of the JSON-Sanitizer and
result in a XSS attack.

## The setup

### Fuzzing where raw data is handled

Fuzzing is most efficient where raw data is parsed, because in this case no
assumptions can be made about the format of the input. The JSON-Sanitizer allows
you to pass arbitrary data to a sanatize function (called
`JsonSanitizer.sanitize`). After sanitization the result is usually passed to a
parser function (called `JsonParser.parse`)

The most universal example of this type of fuzz test can be found in
[`.code-intelligence/fuzz_targets/JsonSanitizerXSSFuzzer.java`](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/JSON-Sanitizer/blob/master/.code-intelligence/fuzz_targets/JsonSanitizerXSSFuzzer.java).
Let me walk you through the heart of the fuzz test:

```Java
public class JsonSanitizerXSSFuzzer {
  // 1. The fuzzer calls fuzzerTestOneInput continuously generating new
  // data in each iteration to maximize code coverage and explore more
  // code.
  public static void fuzzerTestOneInput(FuzzedDataProvider data) {
    // 2. Interpret fuzzer-generated data as String since this is the type
    // expected by the method we want to test
    String input = data.consumeRemainingAsString();
    String safeJSON;
    try {
      // 3. Call the method we want to test with the fuzzer-generated input
      safeJSON = JsonSanitizer.sanitize(input, 10);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      // 4. Ignore all exception since we are here interested in checking if the
      // sanitized output could contain a closing script tag. This property is claimed
      // preserved by the library
      return;
    }

    // 5. Check if the sanitized input can contain the closing script tag. If this is the 
    // case, we report a security issue with high severity since this would result in a XSS 
    // vulnerability.
    assert !safeJSON.contains("</script")
      : new FuzzerSecurityIssueHigh("Output contains </script");
  }
}

```

If you haven't already, you can now explore what the fuzzer found when
running this fuzz test.

### A note regarding corpus data (and why there are more fuzz tests to explore)

For each fuzz test that we write, a corpus of interesting inputs is built up.
Over time, the fuzzer will add more and more inputs to this corpus, based
coverage metrics such as newly-covered lines, statements or even values in an
expression.

### Fuzzing in CI/CD
CI Fuzz allows you to configure your pipeline to automatically trigger the run of fuzz tests.
Most of the fuzzing runs that you can inspect here were triggered automatically (e.g. by pull or merge request on the GitHub project).
As you can see in this [`pull request`](https://github.com/ci-fuzz/JSON-Sanitizer/pull/1)) the fuzzing results are automatically commented by the github-action and developers
can consume the results by clicking on "View Finding" which will lead them directly to the bug description with all the details
that CI Fuzz provides (input that caused the bug, stack trace, bug location).
With this configuration comes the hidden strength of fuzzing into play:  
Fuzzing is not like a penetration test where your application will be tested one time only.
Once you have configured your fuzz test it can help you for the whole rest of your developing cycle.
By running your fuzz test each time when some changes where made to the source code you can quickly check for
regressions and also quickly identify new introduced bugs that would otherwise turn up possibly months 
later during a penetration test or (even worse) in production. This can help to significantly reduce the bug ramp down phase of any project.

While these demo projects are configured to trigger fuzzing runs on merge or pull requests
there are many other configuration options for integrating fuzz testing into your CI/CD pipeline
for example you could also configure your CI/CD to run nightly fuzz tests.
